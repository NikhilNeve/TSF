The Sparks Foundation (TSF) is a non-profit organization that works to promote education and empower students through various programs and initiatives. One of its initiatives is the Graduate Rotational Internship Program (GRIP), which provides students with opportunities to gain practical experience and develop their skills in various fields.

As a Data Science and Business Analytics intern at TSF under the GRIP program, I'm  working on several projects related to data analysis and machine learning. This repository contains the code and documentation for the tasks completed during my internship.
